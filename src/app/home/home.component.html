            <span>Our research group is committed to advancing precision oncology through cutting-edge immunotherapy. By integrating clinical insights with experimental research, we aim to identify biomarkers that predict treatment response and to uncover novel targets for therapeutic intervention.
We investigate a broad range of immunotherapeutic approaches, including immune checkpoint blockade and adoptive cell therapies such as CAR-T and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). Our mission is to enhance treatment precisionâ€”helping clinicians match the right therapy to the right patient, while also driving innovation to improve the therapies already in use.
Rooted in a multidisciplinary environment and closely linked to graduate education, our group fosters collaboration across basic, translational, and clinical research to shape the future of cancer care.
